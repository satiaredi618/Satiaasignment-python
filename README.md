# Question d: Explain the differences between compiled and interpreted programming languages,
# and classify Python in this context.

# Compiled Languages:
# - Translated into machine code before execution.
# - Executed directly by the computer's CPU.
# - Faster execution speed.
# - Examples: C, C++, Rust

# Interpreted Languages:
# - Translated and executed line by line at runtime.
# - Slower execution compared to compiled languages.
# - Easier to debug and more flexible.
# - Examples: Python, JavaScript, Ruby

# Python Classification:
# - Python is an interpreted language.
# - It uses an interpreter (like CPython) to execute code line by line.
# - This makes it easy to use, debug, and portable across platforms.
